Pseudocode

CreatorProfile Struct

Function that creators call to be registered --> createCreatorProfile
Perhaps, I should create a Content.sol smart contract that inherits the CreatorRegistry contract. In this new contract, creators will add their content to the UStream platform by calling a addContent function
Should it be possible for an admin to be able to addContent on behalf of creators?
For the adding(uploading) of content, I have an idea:
Creators upload their content off-chain, this is to enable necessary checks to be performed by the UStream team. Approved content are issued a code which is inputted as a parameter in the addContent function
If this is the case, perhaps only admin should be able to addContent
Perhaps the Content.sol should import Ownable from OpenZeppelin for more security in admin privilegdes

Creator sign-up flow:
>> Creator visits website and fills up sign-up form (off-chain) >> Upon successful approval, they are issued a creatorId >> they visit dApp and create their profile using just the issued creatorId >> smart contract adds the address of whichever calls the createProfile function to the protocol

For now, I will design the smart contract such that only members of the team can add creators. Creators will fill an off-chain form with required details, one of which is their wallet address. After approval, a member of the team adds the address and an off-chain generated creatorId to the protocol. Only these creatorAddresses can add content (will still need to think this through).

In the functions to suspend and remove creators in the CreatorRegistry contract, I should add modifier that utilizes a keccakk256 to ensure that addresses and creatorId match. Should work. Right?

I need to add functions that admins can call to remove/suspend users in the UserRegistry contract. I am also thinking of removing the `select pfp` feature. It should be totally handled off-chain. If I do this, then there should be no need for a Struct declaration. Right? I need to think deeply.
Will write tests later for the CreatorRegistry as is. Or perhaps, I should wait till I implement merkle trees in that contract. Most likely.
